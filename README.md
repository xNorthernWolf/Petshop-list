This is a small script I made for my girlfriend, who is a Littlest Petshop collector.

The script can download The Littlest Petshop from a database (https://lpsmerch.com) and divide them in generations.
After that, you can add them to your collection, keeping an organized list of them.

You'll need Python to make it work, as well as The following Python modules:
```
bs4
requests
natsort
```
Also, to make it work, you'll have to set your directory path in the following file:
```
config.py
```
Everything else is pretty much self-explanatory.


I'm still learning Python, but I intend to add a visual interface later on, for ease of use.
